# CSS

CSS is a language that can be used to add style to an [HTML](/wiki/HTML) page.

##History

CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[21] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[22] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[23] 

##Advantages

**Separation of content from presentation**

- CSS facilitates publication of content in multiple presentation formats based on nominal parameters.

**site-wide consistency**

- When CSS is used effectively, in terms of inheritance and "cascading", a global style sheet can be used to affect and style elements site-wide.

**Bandwidth**

- A stylesheet, internal or external, specifies the style once for a range of HTML elements selected by class, type or relationship to others.
